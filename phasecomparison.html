        <h2>Key Differences Between Phase II and Phase I</h2>
        <p>Phase II builds on the success of Phase I by introducing advanced capabilities such as a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) for intuitive bot configuration and enhanced interoperability between air and ground bots. These improvements address the limitations of Phase I and ensure greater functionality for mission-specific deployments. While Phase II incorporates lessons learned from testing hardware and utilizing the TDP document provided during Phase I, it ultimately reconstructs all mechanical and software components from the ground up to create a more robust and adaptable solution.</p>

        <h2>Inheritance from PODBot Phase I</h2>
        <p>PODBot Phase I was a successful initiative that demonstrated the feasibility of deploying 3D-printed airborne and ground bots for ISR missions. In Phase II, these foundations are refined and expanded to deliver a more mature and robust solution that addresses broader operational needs. Leveraging insights from Phase I's testing hardware and documentation, the team has reimagined the mechanical and software designs from the ground up to ensure enhanced performance and flexibility.</p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>Phase I of PODBot provided valuable insights that have informed the development of Phase II. Key lessons include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System-wide focus:</strong> It is critical to address the entire system rather than concentrating solely on individual components like AirBot and GroundBot. A holistic approach ensures cohesive performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Effective procurement:</strong> Streamlining the acquisition of parts and materials is essential for maintaining timelines and ensuring resource availability during critical phases.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive documentation:</strong> Maintaining detailed and organized records of designs, tests, and iterations is invaluable for development continuity and future upgrades.</li>
        </ul>
