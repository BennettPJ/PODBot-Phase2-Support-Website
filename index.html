        <h2>OV-1</h2>
        <p>The OV-1 Operational View represents PODBotâ€™s ability to deliver ISR solutions rapidly, empowering ground teams with real-time reconnaissance tools that are ready when and where they are needed.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2>Key Differences Between Phase II and Phase I</h2>
        <p>Phase II builds on the success of Phase I by introducing advanced capabilities such as a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) for intuitive bot configuration and enhanced interoperability between air and ground bots. These improvements address the limitations of Phase I and ensure greater functionality for mission-specific deployments. While Phase II incorporates lessons learned from testing hardware and utilizing the TDP document provided during Phase I, it ultimately reconstructs all mechanical and software components from the ground up to create a more robust and adaptable solution.</p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>PODBot is designed for first responders, SWAT teams, Border Patrol, and other domestic agencies that require immediate and reliable ISR capabilities. Its easy-to-use design ensures that non-technical personnel can deploy PODBots with minimal training.</p>

        <h2>Inheritance from PODBot Phase I</h2>
        <p>PODBot Phase I was a successful initiative that demonstrated the feasibility of deploying 3D-printed airborne and ground bots for ISR missions. In Phase II, these foundations are refined and expanded to deliver a more mature and robust solution that addresses broader operational needs. Leveraging insights from Phase I's testing hardware and documentation, the team has reimagined the mechanical and software designs from the ground up to ensure enhanced performance and flexibility.</p>
